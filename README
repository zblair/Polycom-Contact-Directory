Polycom::Contact::Directory version 0.06
================================

This module can be used to parse, modify, or create local contact directory files like those used by
Polycom's SoundPoint IP, SoundStation IP, VVX, Trio, and CCX VoIP phones.

Upon bootup, each phone looks for a file named <Ethernet address>-directory.xml on their boot server,
and if found, downloads and parses the file to build up its local contact directory. In addition to
basic contact information such first/last name and phone number, each contact in the local contact
directory can also include information about speed-dialing, distinctive ring tones, presence, and
instant messaging.

Each <Ethernet address>-directory.xml contains fairly straightforward XML:

  <?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8” standalone=”yes” ?>
  <directory>
   <item_list>
    <item>
     <ln>Doe</ln>
     <fn>John</fn>
     <ct>1001</ct>
     <sd>1</sd>
     <rt>1</rt>
     <dc/>
     <ad>0</ad>
     <ar>0</ar>
     <bw>0</bw>
     <bb>0</bb>
     <up>0</up>
    </item>
      ...
   </item_list>
  </directory>
